## Welcome to RemisB Pages

Hi, I'm freelance golang / java / fullstack software developer.

I will not provide list of technologies I have used because that list will be too long and too technical. Better apploach would be to list what I'm working on now.

## Random thoughts on My Experience, Skills and priorities

* More than 25 years day to day in Software Development
* Spent 15 years on Java / Java EE development. That is too much. I loved language, still do, but time come to switch to Golang.
* Three last year I use golang as my main software development language as main backend and CLI applications.
* Devops 
* Microservices is only way for distributed application development.
* Fullstack developer because browser is most spread common UI platform.
* JavaScript only because it's only language supported in WebBrowser.
* Devops because it's my main priority to stay relevant and productive.
* Blockchain because, somebody asked, feels trendy and why not?
